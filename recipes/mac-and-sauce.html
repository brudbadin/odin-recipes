    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a household staple among the Craig family. The history of this
        recipe can be traced back to the South family. It may look simple, but 
        when cooked correctly it warms both belly and heart. Mac and sauce is 
        traditionally served with a decadent spam sandwich.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Shell Noodles</li>
        <li>16 oz Canned Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Bacon Grease or Vegetable Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Natures Seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add about 1 tablespoon 
            salt to the water.
        </li>
        <li>Add noodles and cook according to package directions, or until al-dante.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, drain water from noodles and return them to the pot.</li>
        <li>Add equal parts tomato sauce and water to the pot with the noodles. 
            We usually just fill the empty can of tomato sauce with water.
        </li>
        <li>Add the bacon grease or oil to the pot and return to heat. Bring to 
            a simmer.
        </li>
        <li>Serve mac and sauce in a bowl, and top with salt, pepper, and natures 
            seasoning to taste. Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
